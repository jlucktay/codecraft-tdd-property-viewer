# Spec by Example - Exercise 5

## Problem statement

> It's very hard to find timeslots in which I can go and view vacant/available properties with a real estate agent.

## Headline feature

> Available viewing timeslots of vacant/available properties are listed in ascending order of soonest first, factoring in travel/drive time and my own availability.

## Supporting features

1. Allow users to connect their calendar, to supply their own availability timings.
2. Be able to get the user's location, to feed into travel time.
3. Details from real estate agents of which properties are available to view when can come into the system somehow (we pull from API, agents push via manual data entry, etc).
4. We track whether a user is still interested or not in each property, when assembling the list of what is upcoming/available.
5. Users can set attributes/filters, e.g. rent X-Y pcm, or buy up to X price, number of bedrooms/bathrooms/parking spaces/etc.
